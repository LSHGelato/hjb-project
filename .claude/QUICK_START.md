# Claude Session Quick Start

1. **Read this file first** to orient yourself
2. **Check PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** for current state and blockers
3. **Check recent_chats** tool to understand what's in progress
4. **Ask clarifying questions** if PROJECT_CONTEXT is stale (hasn't been updated this week)

## When You're Asked to Work on Something
- Use GitHub raw URLs from PROJECT_CONTEXT.md to fetch code
- Check the relevant stage/component files
- Use the naming conventions in NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md
- Always ask: "Is this still the current focus?" if PROJECT_CONTEXT seems old

## When Making Changes
1. Check the current code first
2. Make changes with clear reasoning
3. Provide commit message + CHANGELOG entry
4. Tell Michael what to update in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for next session
